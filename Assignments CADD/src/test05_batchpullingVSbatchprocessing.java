//        In JDBC, batch processing is like doing several database tasks in one go instead of one by one.
//        For example, if you're inserting a lot of records, you can group all the insert statements
//        together and run them at once. This makes your program faster because it talks to the database
//        fewer times. On the other hand, connection pooling is about saving time when connecting to the
//        database. Instead of opening a new connection every time, which is slow, your program reuses a
//        pool of already opened connections. This helps improve performance and reduces the load on the
//        database server.
